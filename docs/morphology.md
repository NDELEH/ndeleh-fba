# 🐟 Morphology Types

N-FBA classifies the final structure into biological "fish shapes."

## Possible Morphologies

### 1. Linear
Long spine, few ribs.

### 2. Rib-Heavy
Short spine, many ribs.

### 3. Clustered
Large rib clusters from one region.

### 4. Curved
Spine bends due to graph structure.

### 5. Sparse
Minimal branching.

## Why Morphology Matters

It helps interpret:

- data shape  
- association density  
- memory complexity  
- cluster strength
