# 📘 Ndeleh Fish Bone Algorithm (N-FBA) Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation of the **Ndeleh Fish Bone Algorithm (N-FBA)** —  
a biologically-inspired associative intelligence model invented by **Ndeleh (2025)**.

## 🔍 What is N-FBA?

The Ndeleh Fish Bone Algorithm is a new form of associative search that mimics biological processes of memory and recall. It works by building:

- A dynamic **spine** (main associative path)
- **Ribs** (secondary associations)
- **Micro-ribs** (weaker, deeper associations)
- An overall **morphology** describing the shape of the graph

N-FBA adapts its structure based on the data, producing shapes such as:

- linear
- rib-heavy
- clustered
- curved
- sparse

This adaptive structure is what makes N-FBA unique.
