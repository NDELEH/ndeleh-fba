# 🦴 Rib & Micro-Rib Expansion

Ribs represent secondary associations branching off the spine.

---

## What are Ribs?

Ribs are nodes connected to spine nodes but not part of the main path.

They represent:

- side ideas  
- secondary thoughts  
- parallel associations  

---

## Recursion: Micro-Ribs

Micro-ribs are generated by recursively applying:

\[
Score = parent\_score \cdot weight \cdot \delta
\]

Each deeper level decays faster.
